To set up an interface in **Visual KPI Server Manager**, you will need to know the prerequisites, how to install a new interface in your system, and how to verify interface connections. You can find this information on this page.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting interfaces to Visual KPI, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Have Visual KPI Server and Server Manager installed.
- Have the data source client tools installed on the **Visual KPI Server**. For example, SQL Server Management Studio, proper Oracle drivers (and a client to test them, such as Toad), PI SDK for OSIsoft, etc.  
- Have the necessary rights and knowledge to access the database, test the connection, and query the desired data.

## Steps for Installing Visual KPI Interfaces

Regardless of the data source, the process of setting up a Visual KPI interface involves these standard procedures:

1. Make sure to install the native client tools of the data source on the **Visual KPI Server**. You can find links to the vendor drivers and other necessary software in [Prerequisites and Downloads](/setup-and-administration/installation/prepare-your-system).
2. Using **Visual KPI Server Manager**, install the interface.
    1. In **Visual KPI Server Manager**, select the site you desire to install a new interface.
    2. Right-click in the **Interfaces** tab, and select the **Install New Visual KPI Interface** option.
    3. Select the interface you want to install from [all available interfaces](/setup-and-administration/interfaces/available-interfaces) presented.
    4. An install wizard will open.
    5. Follow the installation process, adding the necessary information as requested.

  For Interfaces that need further configurations, refer to the [Working with Interfaces](/setup-and-administration/interfaces/odbc) page.
  </Callout>

3. [Verify the connection](#verifying-an-interface-connection).
4. [Test the connection](#testing-an-interface-connection).
5. Use [Visual KPI Designer](/visual-kpi-designer/overview) to define an interface for a KPI.

Below, you will find a visual guide to these steps:

After these steps, you will have your new interface ready. Most interfaces in Visual KPI are pre-packaged interfaces that include all components and are configured along the installation wizard without the need for queries.

## Verifying an Interface Connection

After installing and configuring the interface, use Visual KPI Server Manager to verify the interface's database connection.

Click **Verify Connection** after right-clicking the interface. A message appears indicating success or failure.

If there were any errors, make the required changes to the Connect String and/or Queries and repeat the verification.
</Callout>

## Testing an Interface Connection

You can use Visual KPI Server Manager to test the interface connection and access the database. To test it, follow the steps below:

1. Right-click the ODBC interface and select **Browse**. Your browser will open and display the Interface's Web Service page. The image below is an example of how this page looks:

<Image 
  src="media/setup-and-administration/interfaces/configuration/test1.png" 
/>

2. Click any of the Test links displayed on the Web Service page.
3. In the **LookupValue** field, enter a valid lookup name and click the **Invoke** button, as exemplified bellow.

/>

4. A new instance of your browser will open, with content similar to the following image:

<Image 
  src="media/setup-and-administration/interfaces/configuration/test3.png" 
/>

Search for the test results within the `<NewDataSet xmlns=””>` entry. The results of the test are within this entry. If the connection and security settings are valid, a value is returned.
