The Setup and Administration documentation covers all steps required to download and install Visual KPI in the local or cloud environments. You can also find documentation on how to use interfaces to connect data sources to Visual KPI or automate the process using the Remote Context Server (RCS). The individual in charge of this part of the process is called the Administrator. For Transpara, the Administrator is likely an IT team member who is responsible for the Visual KPI integration, including system preparation and installation.
