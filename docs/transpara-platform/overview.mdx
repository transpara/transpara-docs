<Callout title="Transpara Platform is under development" type="success">
Welcome to the journey from Visual KPI to the all new Transpara real-time operational intelligence platform. The new platform is already being battle-tested with major customers (let us know if you want to take part), but is also still in development. The documentation will be updated over time as new features are released. Stay tuned for more updates!
</Callout>

The Transpara Platform is a modern, AI-optimized operational intelligence system designed to unify, analyze and visualize data from all your industrial and business systems, without the time, effort and cost of migrating data and manually creating the results. With real-time insights, mobile-ready interfaces, and optional data storage, Transpara empowers organizations to act faster, reduce cost, and stay ahead of performance issues.

## What is Transpara?

Transpara connects to hundreds of live and historical data sources, ranging from sensors and PLCs to enterprise systems and cloud APIs, without requiring data migration or duplication. It builds a Virtual Data Lake that lets users interact with live, modeled, or calculated data as if it were in a single system.

At the core of the platform is a set of modular components (tStore, tCalc, tModel, tStudio, and tView), each designed for a specific role in the data lifecycle, from ingestion and modeling to calculation and visualization.

## What problems does it solve?

Traditional analytics and monitoring tools often require:
- Manual data copying and synchronization.
- Slow, after-the-fact reporting.
- Complex integrations between data systems.
- Reliance on IT or data scientists for simple questions.

Transpara addresses these challenges by:
- Eliminating the need for migration through direct data connections.
- Offering real-time KPIs, alerts, and dashboards out of the box.
- Enabling operations, engineering, and business users to build, manage, and use analytics without writing code.
- Supporting AI-assisted modeling and event-driven analytics for fast, intelligent decisions.

## Core value propositions

- **Real-time from the source**: See what's happening now with streaming analytics and live updates across devices.
- **Mobile-first**: Every view is accessible from any device, with responsive design and no feature loss.
- **No forced migration**: Use your existing systems and data sources; store data only when needed.
- **AI integration**: Apply AI to build smarter models, run predictions, and accelerate root cause analysis.

## Key industries and use cases

Transpara is used globally across industries that depend on high-frequency, distributed, or mission-critical data. Typical use cases include:

- **Energy and Utilities**: Asset monitoring, load balancing, outage detection.
- **Manufacturing and Pharma**: Line performance, quality assurance, OEE.
- **Oil & Gas**: Remote site tracking, pump efficiency, safety metrics.
- **IT & Data Centers**: Infrastructure health, capacity planning, alerting.
- **Mining and Infrastructure**: Fleet coordination, sensor integration, environmental metrics.
- **Telecom**: Tower uptime, service metrics, operational KPIs.

## What makes Transpara different?

Unlike traditional BI platforms or SCADA systems:

| Feature                          | Traditional BI / SCADA          | Transpara Platform                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Data access                      | Requires migration or ETL        | Connects directly to live data               |
| Responsiveness                   | Scheduled batch updates          | Real-time, event-driven                      |
| User experience                  | Complex, Custom, IT-led                  | Obvious, intuitive, and mobile-ready         |
| Scalability                      | Tightly coupled deployments      | Cloud, on-prem, and hybrid deployments       |
| Intelligence                     | Static reports                   | AI-assisted modeling and alerting            |
| Collaboration                    | Minimal                          | Built-in sharing, alerts, and discussions    |

Transpara bridges the gap between operational systems and analytical tools, offering the speed of SCADA, the flexibility of BI, and the intelligence of AI in one unified platform.
