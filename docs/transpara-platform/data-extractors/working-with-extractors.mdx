<Callout title="Have questions, or don't see a specific data source?" type="success"> Transpara supports thousands of data sources so we can't list them all, so please reach out to us and we can discuss your specific data sources, interfaces, extractors, remote context services (RCS) or other integrations. </Callout>

Extractors are lightweight services that move operational and historical data from external systems into tStore, Transpara’s high-speed time-series database/historian and analytics cache. They are ideal when you need to collect, backfill, cache, or stream data continuously from industrial historians, control systems, or sources that do not store historical data.

Unlike Interfaces, which connect directly to live data sources without data migration, Extractors read and replicate data into tStore. 

## How Extractors Work

Each Extractor runs as an independent service (for Windows-specific sources, a Windows service built on .NET Framework). When configured, the service connects to the specified data source, collects live or historical data, and streams it into tStore using secure, batched uploads.

Key capabilities shared across all Extractors include:

*   Automatic recovery in case of connection loss or restart  
      
    
*   Configurable buffering and memory management for performance stability  
      
    
*   Multi-threaded processing for large-scale data movement  
      
    
*   Built-in web interface (/settings-ui) for configuration and monitoring  
      
    

You can install, start, and manage Extractors using standard commands or through the included web-based configuration panel.

  

## Before You Begin

Before installing or configuring an Extractor:

1.  Confirm network access to both the source system (e.g., OPC server, databases or PI server) and tStore.  
      
    
2.  Verify that the host system meets all prerequisites (.NET Framework for  Windows, SDKs, and permissions).  
      
    
3.  Ensure the service account  (NetworkService for Windows-specific extractors) has Full Control permissions on the installation directory.  
      
    
4.  Check that firewall and DCOM (if Windows-based) settings (where applicable) allow communication with the data source.  
      
    

Each Extractor page provides detailed setup and configuration instructions tailored to its protocol.
