This guide outlines the recommended hardware and software requirements, along with setup instructions for deploying tSystem on Kubernetes. Each section provides OS-specific steps for configuring a reliable environment, followed by optional steps for advanced setups.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Operating System**:
  - Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 or 9
  - SUSE Linux Enterprise / openSUSE 15 SP6
  
- **Storage**:
  - OS (boot): 500GB NVMe SSD
  - Data: 1â€“2TB NVMe SSD (depending on data scope and retention needs)
  
  :::tip

  - For high-availability storage in Kubernetes, consider remote network-attached storage (e.g., NFS, cloud-managed solutions) for resilient, multi-node access.
  - Unmounted storage is typically preferred for Kubernetes environments, allowing dynamic mounting as managed by Kubernetes

  :::

- **Memory**:
  - Preferred: 64GB RAM
  - Minimum: 16GB RAM (scalable as needed)
  
- **CPU**:
  - Preferred: 16 CPUs
  - Minimum: 8 CPUs (scalable as needed)
