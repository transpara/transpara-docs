## Hardware Requirements

- **Operating System**:
  - Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 or 9

  :::tip

  - For high-availability storage in Kubernetes, consider remote network-attached storage (e.g., NFS, cloud-managed solutions) for resilient, multi-node access.
  - Unmounted storage is typically preferred for Kubernetes environments, allowing dynamic mounting as managed by Kubernetes

  :::

- **Memory**:
  - Preferred: 64GB RAM
  - Minimum: 16GB RAM (scalable as needed)
  
- **CPU**:
  - Preferred: 16 CPUs
