This guide outlines the recommended hardware and software requirements, along with setup instructions for deploying tSystem on Kubernetes. Each section provides OS-specific steps for configuring a reliable environment, followed by optional steps for advanced setups.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Operating System**:
  - Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 or 9
  - SUSE Linux Enterprise / openSUSE 15 SP6
  
- **Storage**:
  - OS (boot): 500GB NVMe SSD
  - Data: 1â€“2TB NVMe SSD (depending on data scope and retention needs)
  
  :::tip

  - For high-availability storage in Kubernetes, consider remote network-attached storage (e.g., NFS, cloud-managed solutions) for resilient, multi-node access.
  - Unmounted storage is typically preferred for Kubernetes environments, allowing dynamic mounting as managed by Kubernetes

  :::

- **Memory**:
  - Preferred: 64GB RAM
  - Minimum: 16GB RAM (scalable as needed)
  
- **CPU**:
  - Preferred: 16 CPUs
  - Minimum: 8 CPUs (scalable as needed)

## Software Requirements

- **User permissions**: Ensure you have a user with sudo access.
- **Directory Setup** (recommended):
  - Create a dedicated directory for the installation files (e.g., `/transpara`).
  - Set the user as the owner and ensure write access to the directory.
- **Disk Mounting** (recommended):
  - Mount a dedicated disk for storage. This disk can be used for both installation files and data storage. This disk can be mounted or be the same as the recommended directory for the installation files (e.g. `/transpara`). 
  - Please ensure the user has write access to the dedicated disk.
- **Firewall configuration**:
  - ubuntu: [Ubuntu / Debian firewall instructions](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements?os=debian#operating-systems)
  - rhel: [Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS / Fedora Instructions](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements?os=rhel#operating-systems)
  - sles: [SUSE Linux Enterprise / openSuse](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements?os=suse#operating-systems)
- **Install open-iscsi**:
  - ubuntu:

    ```bash
    apt-get install open-iscsi
    ```

  - rhel:

    ```bash
    yum --setopt=tsflags=noscripts install iscsi-initiator-utils
    echo "InitiatorName=$(/sbin/iscsi-iname)" > /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi
    systemctl enable iscsid
    systemctl start iscsid
    ```

  - sles:

    ```bash
    sudo zypper install open-iscsi
    sudo systemctl enable iscsid
    sudo systemctl start iscsid
    ```

- **Network configuration**:
verify netstat is installed:
  - ubuntu:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install net-tools
    ```

  - rhel:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install net-tools
    ```

  - sles:
  Note: `netstat` is deprecated in openSUSE 15+, it's recommended to use `ss` instead.

    ```bash
    sudo zypper install net-tools
    ```

### Multipath Configuration

Multipath is a Linux feature that manages multiple connections to storage devices, commonly used with enterprise storage systems like SAN (Storage Area Network). Since the `tsystem` deployment uses Longhorn for Kubernetes storage, multipath must be configured to avoid conflicts with Longhorn volumes. This section provides step-by-step instructions to check and configure multipath based on the storage setup.

**Before Starting**:

- Determine if the environment uses **SAN or shared storage** (e.g., iSCSI, Fibre Channel, or cloud-based storage like AWS EBS, Azure Disks).
  - **SAN/shared storage in use**: Keep multipath enabled and configure it to exclude Longhorn volumes.
  - **Local disks or Longhorn only**: Disable multipath to prevent issues.

:::warning
Be sure to apply the correct Multipath configuration on **all Kubernetes nodes** in the cluster to avoid inconsistent behavior.
:::

#### Step 1: Check Multipath Status

Multipath may be running by default. Use the appropriate command to check its status based on the operating system.

```bash
sudo systemctl status multipathd
```

**Expected Output**:

- `active (running)` indicates multipath is enabled.
- `inactive` or `dead` indicates multipath is not running. If no SAN/shared storage is used, proceed to **Step 3**.

#### Step 2: Configure Multipath for SAN/Shared Storage (If Applicable)

When using SAN or shared storage, keep multipath enabled but configure it to exclude Longhorn volumes to prevent mount failures.

1. **Edit or Create Multipath Configuration File**:
   - Open or create `/etc/multipath.conf` with a text editor:
  
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/multipath.conf
     ```

   - Add the following to exclude Longhorn volumes:

     ```bash
     blacklist {
         devnode "^sd[a-z0-9]+"
     }
     ```

   - Save and exit (in `nano`, press `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`).

2. **Restart Multipath Service**:
   - Apply changes by restarting the service:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart multipathd.service
     ```

3. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Confirm the blacklist is applied:

     ```bash
     multipath -t
     ```

   - Look for the `blacklist` section with `devnode "^sd[a-z0-9]+"` in the output.

#### Step 3: Disable Multipath (If No SAN/Shared Storage)

When using local disks or Longhorn without SAN/shared storage, disable multipath to avoid conflicts.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop multipathd
sudo systemctl disable multipathd
```

#### Step 4: Apply to All Nodes

- Repeat **Step 1** and either **Step 2** (for SAN) or **Step 3** (no SAN) on every Kubernetes node to ensure consistent configuration.
