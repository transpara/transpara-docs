<Callout title="Transpara Platform is under development" type="success">
The new Transpara Platform is currently in development. This documentation will be updated as new features are released. Stay tuned for more updates!
</Callout>

Transpara is designed to be deployed flexibly, on-premise, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments, using container-based technologies that support scalability, modularity, and high availability. This page explains supported deployment models, configuration strategies, and system architecture.

## Containerized infrastructure

Transpara is packaged using Docker containers and orchestrated through Kubernetes, enabling modular deployment across any infrastructure.

### Benefits:
- **Scalable**: Add or remove components based on load and data volume.
- **High availability**: Redundant instances and failover support.
- **Modular**: Deploy only the components you need (e.g., tCalc, tView, tStudio).
- **Environment agnostic**: Compatible with bare metal, VMs, or managed Kubernetes services.

### Components typically containerized:
- tStore
- tCalc
- tDataGateway
- tModel (via tGraph)
- tStudio, tView
- tEventBroker
- tAuth
- Monitoring tools

## On-premise vs cloud deployment

Transpara supports multiple deployment environments. You can host it in:

### On-premise
- Full control over security and data governance
- Ideal for regulated industries (e.g., pharma, energy)
- Integration with local systems like SCADA, DCS, or PI

### Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Elastic infrastructure scaling
- Easy integration with cloud-native services
- Managed Kubernetes and container services support (e.g., EKS, AKS, GKE)

### Hybrid
- Combine cloud compute with on-prem data storage
- Use the Bridge Release model to extend legacy systems gradually


## Bridge release model

The Bridge Release strategy allows for gradual migration from legacy systems to Transpara. You can run Transpara in parallel with existing tools (e.g., traditional historians, Excel-based workflows) without full replacement.

This approach supports:
- Side-by-side evaluation and rollout
- Continuous syncing of metadata and data streams
- Progressive onboarding of teams and departments
- Minimal risk of disruption

## Security and system health

Transpara includes built-in security, authentication, and monitoring capabilities to ensure robust system operation.

### Authentication (tAuth)
- Supports LDAP, Active Directory, OpenID, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0
- Centralized user management
- Role-based access control for modules and views

### Monitoring
- Health status dashboards within tStudio
- Logging and alerting per service container
- Integration with third-party tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
