The new Transpara Platform is currently in development. This documentation will be updated as new features are released. Stay tuned for more updates!
</Callout>

tStudio is the web-based configuration environment for the Transpara Platform. It serves as the central workspace where users define models, create calculation templates, configure deployments, and monitor system health.

Built for administrators, authors, and advanced users, tStudio simplifies the management of complex analytics systems through visual tools, AI-assisted setup, and real-time feedback.


## What it does

tStudio allows you to:
- Build and maintain your semantic model (tModel) using intuitive visual editors.
- Create and version templates for real-time calculations in tCalc.
- Configure dashboards, KPIs, and views shown in tView.
- Manage user roles, authentication, and deployment-specific settings.
- Monitor the health of system components, including data interfaces and calculation engines.

All configuration is performed directly in the browser, no coding required.


## How it works

tStudio interacts with all core modules in the platform:

- **tModel integration**: Design asset hierarchies, link nodes, and apply templates via a drag-and-drop interface.
- **tCalc management**: Define calculation templates, assign them to modeled objects, and test execution in real time.
- **Deployment awareness**: tStudio adapts to your environment, showing site-specific views and controlling local configurations.
- **Role-based access**: Features and permissions are customized based on the userâ€™s role (Admin, Author, Viewer).

Through its AI-powered design assistant, tStudio can also suggest model structures, detect configuration gaps, and recommend best practices.

## Example use cases

- Create a semantic model for a multi-site energy monitoring system.
- Assign OEE and energy cost templates to each production unit.
- Define access roles for admins and plant operators.
- Monitor data interface status and correct configuration issues.
