<Callout title="Transpara Platform is under development" type="success">
The new Transpara Platform is currently in development. This documentation will be updated as new features are released. Stay tuned for more updates!
</Callout>

The Transpara Platform is made up of modular components, each responsible for a key function, from data ingestion and processing to modeling, calculation, visualization, and configuration. These modules work together to transform raw data into real-time insights.

This page introduces each of the core modules and explains how they connect to form a complete operational intelligence system.

## How the modules connect

The platform's architecture is designed to be event-driven, modular, and graph-based.

- **tStore**: Manages time-series data, providing both temporary caches and persistent storage when needed.
- **tCalc**: Executes real-time and event-triggered calculations using input data and metadata from tStore and tModel.
- **tModel**: Defines the semantic structure of your system, assets, KPIs, templates, within a unified knowledge graph.
- **tStudio**: Offers a web-based environment for configuring the platform, creating models, defining templates, managing access, and more.
- **tView**: Provides dashboards and visualizations for users to view KPIs, alerts, and analytics results in real time.

The system's **tDataGateway** coordinates data delivery between the backend and the user interface, while **tEventBroker** ensures real-time updates across modules.
