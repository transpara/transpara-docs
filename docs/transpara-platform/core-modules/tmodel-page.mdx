tModel is the semantic modeling layer of the Transpara Platform. It structures your data by defining relationships between assets, KPIs, metrics, templates, and organizational hierarchies. This model-driven foundation enables consistency, scalability, and reusability across the entire system.

tModel is built on top of tGraph, a high-performance graph database powered by MEM Graph. It stores and links nodes (representing entities like machines, sensors, KPIs, or systems) to reflect your operational structure.


## What it does

tModel enables you to:
- Build a digital representation of your physical and logical systems.
- Assign KPIs, alerts, and calculation logic to specific assets or groups.
- Apply reusable templates to multiple objects using a unified structure.
- Define hierarchies, relationships, and naming conventions across your enterprise.

This graph-based structure is essential for complex environments where context, relationships, and inheritance matter, like manufacturing lines, power grids, or multi-site operations.


## How it works

tModel stores and organizes data using nodes and edges, where:
- **Nodes** represent physical or logical items (e.g., pumps, sensors, departments, KPIs).
- **Edges** define relationships (e.g., "is part of", "monitors", "calculates").

The model is maintained in tGraph, the underlying graph database. Users configure and edit it through tStudio, which provides tools to:
- Import external metadata (e.g., from PI AF, SQL, or spreadsheets).
- Create new nodes and link them using standard relationship types.
- Apply calculation templates and visualization settings to objects.

Once the model is created, it powers everything else, calculations in tCalc, visualizations in tView, and context-aware analytics.


## Main features

| Feature                             | Description                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Graph-based modeling**            | Uses a flexible, scalable graph to represent real-world systems.              |
| **Unified Naming Space (UNS)**      | Enables consistent naming and referencing across all components.             |
| **Reusable templates**              | Apply standard logic or display settings across many assets or KPIs.         |
| **Inheritance and hierarchy**       | Child nodes can inherit attributes or calculations from parent structures.   |
| **External metadata import**        | Supports automated model creation from sources like PI AF or SQL.            |
| **Tied to tCalc and tView**         | Provides structure and context for calculations and dashboards.              |
