<Callout title="Transpara Platform is under development" type="success">
Welcome to the journey from Visual KPI to the all new Transpara real-time operational intelligence platform. The new platform is already being battle-tested with major customers (let us know if you want to take part), but is also still in development. The documentation will be updated over time as new features are released. Stay tuned for more updates!
</Callout>

tModel is the semantic modeling layer of the Transpara Platform. It structures your data by defining relationships between assets, KPIs, metrics, templates, and organizational hierarchies. This model-driven foundation enables consistency, scalability, and reusability across the entire system.

tModel is built on top of tGraph, a high-performance graph database powered by MEM Graph. It stores and links nodes (representing entities like machines, sensors, KPIs, or systems) to reflect your operational structure.


## What it does

tModel enables you to:
- Build a digital representation of your physical and logical systems.
- Assign KPIs, alerts, and calculation logic to specific assets or groups.
- Apply reusable templates to multiple objects using a unified structure.
- Define hierarchies, relationships, and naming conventions across your enterprise.

This graph-based structure is essential for complex environments where context, relationships, and inheritance matter, like manufacturing lines, power grids, or multi-site operations.


## How it works

tModel stores and organizes data using nodes and edges, where:
- **Nodes** represent physical or logical items (e.g., pumps, sensors, departments, KPIs).
- **Edges** define relationships (e.g., "is part of", "monitors", "calculates").

The model is maintained in tGraph, the underlying graph database. Users configure and edit it through tStudio, which provides tools to:
- Import external metadata (e.g., from PI AF, SQL, or spreadsheets).
- Create new nodes and link them using standard relationship types.
- Apply calculation templates and visualization settings to objects.

Once the model is created, it powers everything else, calculations in tCalc, visualizations in tView, and context-aware analytics.


## Main features

| Feature                             | Description                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Graph-based modeling**            | Uses a flexible, scalable graph to represent real-world systems.              |
| **Unified Naming Space (UNS)**      | Enables consistent naming and referencing across all components.             |
| **Reusable templates**              | Apply standard logic or display settings across many assets or KPIs.         |
| **Inheritance and hierarchy**       | Child nodes can inherit attributes or calculations from parent structures.   |
| **External metadata import**        | Supports automated model creation from sources like PI AF or SQL.            |
| **Tied to tCalc and tView**         | Provides structure and context for calculations and dashboards.              |
