<Callout title="Transpara Platform is under development" type="success">
The new Transpara Platform is currently in development. This documentation will be updated as new features are released. Stay tuned for more updates!
</Callout>

tStore is the Transpara Platform's time-series data engine. It provides flexible, high-performance storage for streaming and historical data, acting both as an analytics cache and an optional primary data source.

Built on [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/), tStore is optimized for long-running, high-frequency, and large-volume calculations. It enables the platform to deliver fast, consistent results, whether working with real-time sensor streams or batch-imported datasets.


## What it does

tStore is responsible for:
- Storing time-series and performance data from multiple sources.
- Caching results from real-time calculations and analytics.
- Serving as an optional long-term database when live access is unavailable or impractical.
- Reconstructing historical views using static files, spreadsheets, or other archived data.


## How it works

tStore operates as a scalable storage layer within the platform. It receives inputs from:
- Live data sources (via pass-through interfaces and extractors).
- Processed results from tCalc.
- Uploaded or batch-imported files (CSV, JSON, text logs).

Data is organized into high-resolution time-series tables, indexed for fast querying. The system automatically aggregates data based on frequency, use case, and retention settings, allowing analytics to scale without manual tuning.

tStore integrates directly with:
- **tCalc** for on-demand and event-driven computations.
- **tModel** to ensure stored data is contextually mapped to your semantic model.
- **tStudio** for managing storage settings, retention, and upload options.


## Main features

| Feature                          | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Built on TimescaleDB**         | Combines SQL flexibility with time-series performance.                     |
| **Optional persistence**         | Store data when needed; skip it when live data is sufficient.              |
| **Analytics cache**              | Accelerates repeated calculations by storing prior results.                |
| **History from files**           | Import CSV, Excel, JSON, or text to recreate past performance data.        |
| **Automatic aggregation**        | Supports downsampling and long-period queries without performance loss.    |
| **High availability**            | Can be scaled and replicated in container-based deployments.               |
| **Supports structured queries**  | Easily accessed by tCalc, dashboards, or external tools.                 |

## When to use tStore

Use tStore when you need to:
- Store and analyze large volumes of time-series data over time.
- Reuse previously calculated results for performance optimization.
- Preserve and visualize historical performance from non-streaming sources.
- Support dashboards that must display recent trends or full history.
