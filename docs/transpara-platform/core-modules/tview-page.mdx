<Callout title="Transpara Platform is under development" type="success">
The new Transpara Platform is currently in development. This documentation will be updated as new features are released. Stay tuned for more updates!
</Callout>

tView is the Transpara Platform's real-time visualization and collaboration interface. It displays KPIs, metrics, alerts, and dashboards tailored for decision-makers, engineers, and field operators, on any device.

Designed for speed and clarity, tView lets users monitor performance, detect anomalies, and collaborate across teams without technical training. It's fully mobile-optimized and updates live via the platform's event-driven architecture.


## What it does

tView transforms calculated and modeled data into intuitive visualizations. It provides:
- Real-time dashboards that reflect the current state of operations.
- Alerts and notifications for threshold breaches or anomalies.
- Interactive charts and tables for exploring trends and comparisons.
- A collaborative interface where users can annotate, share, and discuss data.

It's where insights become actions, supporting rapid decision-making on the shop floor, in the control room, or in the field.


## How it works

tView receives its data through two core platform components:

- **tDataGateway**: Serves as the unified API layer, delivering structured data from tCalc, tStore, and tModel.
- **tEventBroker**: Sends real-time updates via MQTT, ensuring dashboards stay synchronized with live system events.

Dashboards are configured in tStudio and automatically reflect the models, templates, and KPIs defined in the platform. Users can personalize views, subscribe to alerts, and access the interface securely from desktop or mobile devices.
