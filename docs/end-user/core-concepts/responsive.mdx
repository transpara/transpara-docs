Transpara's Visual KPIs is a responsive software designed and developed to adapt and function effectively across various devices, screen sizes, and resolutions. It adapts to ensure that the user interface and user experience remain consistent and optimized, regardless of the device used to access the software.

You can effortlessly use Visual KPI on various web browser devices, including phones, PCs, or screens with different operating systems or sizes, eliminating concerns about compatibility or screen configurations.

Your Visual KPIs adjust dynamically based on the screen size and orientation of the device. Elements reposition and resize themselves to fit the available space without sacrificing usability or readability. User interactions and functionalities are optimized for input methods like touchscreens, keyboards, or mouse controls. This compatibility ensures that users experience the same software performance regardless of their preferred browser.
