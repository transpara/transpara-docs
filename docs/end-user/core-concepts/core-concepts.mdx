In this section, you can learn the essential ideas to become a pro at using Visual KPI. These concepts lay the groundwork for a better understanding of the software, making it easier to get started.

Transpara's system is an easy-to-use software that unifies all kinds of data into Visual KPIs that help organizations worldwide make assertive decisions based on real-time information. Its friendly user interface (UI) was designed to be easy to understand, customizable, and efficient in data analysis to enhance decision-making and improve the user adoption of the tool.

## Main concepts

- **[KPI](/docs/end-user/core-concepts/kpi)**: You can use KPIs to keep track of any information that serves as a metric to indicate the performance of critical activities within a company. They're essential for decision-makers, providing insights into performance trends and guiding strategic adjustments. Even though the data is gathered from several sources, the quick data processing and intuitive visualization enable users from different roles to visualize and supervise critical aspects of their work and make assertive decisions.

- **[Browser](/docs/end-user/core-concepts/browser)**: End-users don't need to install software since the system is accessed through a web browser. You can use it with any operational system on your laptop, phone, or big screens across your plant. Anything that can run a web browser can be used to leverage Visual KPIs. You can create as many profiles as needed, selecting and editing the groups, dashboards, visualizations, and alerts for each one. This flexibility allows users to build their ideal Visual KPIs to improve their experience.

- **[Responsive](/docs/end-user/core-concepts/responsive)**: Transpara's system prioritizes user experience by adapting its interface and features to suit different devices, ensuring accessibility and usability regardless of the platform. You can run it on any screen size. You don't need to worry about screen configurations to present your KPIs.

- **[Real-Time](/docs/end-user/core-concepts/real-time)**: You don't have to refresh the page to update the data. Visual KPI's system runs in real-time, keeping you updated all the time. The user can configure the cash cycle for the data update and change it for trend analysis, receiving an immediate result for their search.

- **[Interactive](/docs/end-user/core-concepts/interactive)**: Visual KPI is an interactive tool designed to help decision-making in real time. Its interactivity relies on users' freedom to build their KPIs views using various resources such as data dashboards, charts, tables, and trends. Each person has their preferences on how to view data. With Visual KPI, you can create as many profiles as you need to guarantee that everyone in your organization can access the information they need.

- **Status, color, and alerting**: The importance of status, color, and alerts in Visual KPIs lies in their ability to condense complex data into easily understandable visual representations. Users can focus on critical areas that require action or further analysis and make immediate decisions. Colors in Visual KPIs help distinguish between statuses such as good, satisfactory, and critical performance levels. Alerts enable users to take proactive measures when a KPI exceeds or falls below expected levels. Using these configurations, you can quickly grasp whether a particular metric meets expectations, falls short, or indicates an issue.
