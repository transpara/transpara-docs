Visual KPI provides several ways to access information. In this section, you find information on how to use these features. Use this page to learn the basics about each feature, and explore the linked pages for more details.

## Basic navigation features 

Discover the key features that empower your navigation in Visual KPI, allowing you to access and manage information seamlessly.

- **[Profiles](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/profiles)**: A profile consists of custom dashboards, a bookmark bar, and a watch list of important KPIs. You can create as many profiles as you need, customize them as you want, and switch between them anytime. Depending on how your team configures Visual KPI, you may have Private and Public profiles available.

- **[Dashboards](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/dashboards)**: Visual KPI Dashboards are linked to profiles, and you can monitor all your operational information from them. You can have as many dashboards as you need. You can personalize them and add new visualizations to fit your purposes. The dashboard can be your personalized or role-based visualization of KPIs, charts, groups, and tables.

- **[Hierarchy/Groups](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/groups)**: Hierarchy or Groups define how you organize information within Visual KPI. It works as the folders on your computer, so you can have as many groups as you need, with unlimited levels. Moreover, groups can contain several objects at any hierarchy level, including KPIs, charts, tables, or other groups. Organizing your KPIs and other objects into groups helps you understand your problems and reflect on your process organization.

- **[Visualizations](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/visualization)**: Visual KPI provides several visualization options you can use simply by clicking a button. Easily changing between visualizations helps you quickly access data in the best format at any time.

- **[Search](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/search)**: Visual KPI embeds a large volume of information, and during its use, you may need to find specific information for any reason. You can use the Search Bar to get live results from all dashboards, groups, KPIs, charts, and tables that meet your search input. This feature shows you the top five search results within each object type, and you can click an object type to see all results that include the parameter you entered. The search results also present the KPI status to quickly access vital information.

- **[Analytics](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/analytics)**: Analytics, or Ad Hoc Trends, are a custom type of trend you can build in your Visual KPI, add to your Dashboard, and monitor in real-time. For instance, if you are having trouble with multiple KPIs, you can trend them against each other to analyze if there is any correlation between them. You can create an Ad Hoc Trend from any KPI List View, using up to 20 KPIs (also called "pens"), and change the period for your analysis.

- **[Alerts](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/alerts)**: Visual KPI sends alert notifications or reminders to contact emails when any KPIs need attention. Every notification includes a link back to Visual KPI that takes you to a KPI live trend of the exact moment the alert occurred.

- **[Dark/Light Themes](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/dark-light-theme)**: Transpara team knows that some folks prefer to work in the dark. That is why you can change the Visual KPI interface between light and dark mode. Admins can configure light and dark themes, set defaults, and decide whether users can change defaults. They can also customize how the KPIs' status appear in light and dark themes, selecting colors for each theme and each status.

- **[Time](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/time)**: Visual KPI shows your data in near real-time. You can display the KPIs' time based on server or client time, facilitating cases when they are in different time zones. In addition to the time reference, you can work with time ranges in Visual KPI. You can define a standard time range, customize a different time range for each object, or even display the same object using different time ranges.
