    <Accordion title="How quickly can you spin up a pilot?">
      We can spin up a pilot in less than four weeks.
      A normal pilot is up and running in a matter of days. We focused on making Transpara productized, not projectware, so it doesn't require a ton of IT work. Transpara doesn't have six-month evaluations, consultants, etc., so you can spend more time thinking about what you really care about. 
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="How long does a pilot normally last?">
      With our Quickstart Program, you'll get a 60-day license key to ensure fit. During the entire time frame, we support you as a full-blown customer.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="How quickly can you convert the pilot into a full system deployment?">
      That will depend on the specific scope of your project. Deployments with Transpara are typically fast. Keep in mind that almost 100% of pilots end up being full systems, so we're good at it.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What are the requirements for a pilot?">
      It comes down to time and access on your part. With those two ingredients we can typically get your pilot running in two weeks.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What support do you provide during a pilot?">
      During the first 14 days of the pilot, we work with you to determine criteria of success, establish data source connections, create KPIs and configure dashboards. We also conduct customer discovery to identify objectives for the pilot, then develop a comprehensive solution. Over the next few weeks, we offer ongoing training and support, including tutorials, webinars, and customer support to ensure your team can fully utilize the software and achieve desired results.

    <Accordion title="Who on our side needs to be involved in scoping a pilot or setting up the system?">
      Anyone you want involved, really. You will need:
      - Someone from IT to set up the server.
      - Someone with the right access to data sources and an understanding of the data itself.
      - Someone with authority to act on server.
      - Someone from management or the C-suite.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What is the normal cost of a pilot and what is included?">
      It depends on scope and your criteria for success, but it usually ranges from 15k to 45k.
