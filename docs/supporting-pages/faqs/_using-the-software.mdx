    <Accordion title="Is it possible to add a logo, image, or text box label to the Dashboard?">
      You have the flexibility to add a wide range of items to your Dashboard, such as KPIs, charts, trends, [embedded content](/end-user/features/visualizations/charts) from external sources, groups/hierarchies, and more. Additionally, you can personalize your Dashboard by including [custom logos and other images](/end-user/features/dashboards). You can [add labels, static text, and dynamic objects](/end-user/features/dashboards) from data sources using [Visual KPI Interfaces](/setup-and-administration/interfaces).

      Here is a few examples:

      - Show a safety message to all users (static, or pull a dynamic message from a data source).
      - Show a dynamic text value, such as which batch is currently running or what product you are currently producing.
      - Show a dynamic value, such as a price or temperature.
      - Show a diagram, logo, or another custom image in a resizeable widget anywhere on the dashboard.

    <Accordion title="Is Dashboard to Dashboard navigation possible?">
      Not at this time. Visual KPI Groups are designed to have one active Dashboard per Group, with the exception of the Home group, which already has this Dashboard feature available.

      We are developing a feature that will enable seamless navigation between Dashboards, similar to Group to Group navigation.

    <Accordion title="When using Chrome on a touchscreen, why can't I drag trends in Visual KPI using a cursor?">
      Google Chrome automatically enables touch events on touch-enabled devices. This means Chrome will override the mouse (or touchpad) for some types of events. If you are using Google Chrome on a touchscreen device and cannot see the cursor, you may need to disable touch events.

      To use the cursor (and a mouse or touchpad) on your Visual KPI site so you can drag it for things like box zoom on a trend, disable Touch Events or Touch API (depending on your version of Chrome), do the following:

      1. Open Google Chrome.
      2. In the URL address bar type `chrome://flags/` and press Enter.
      3. Click **Enable touch events > Disabled**.

      On iOS, you won’t see a cursor, but you can use Visual KPI draw/drag tools when you disable drag and drop. To perform this, do these steps:

      1. Open Google Chrome.
      2. In the URL address bar type `chrome://flags/` and press Enter.
      3. Set **Drag and Drop** to **Disabled**.

    <Accordion title="Can I print or save to PDF my dashboards/reports?">
      Yes, it's possible to print and save your dashboards and reports from Visual KPI in PDF format. This can be done easily by using third-party tools like [HTML TO PDF Converter](https://www.html-to-pdf.net/). These tools are capable of converting complex HTML pages, such as those in Visual KPI, into properly formatted PDF files. Printing or saving to PDF directly from your web browser often results in unprofessional formatting. To avoid this issue, use HTML to PDF conversion softwares instead.

    <Accordion title="What is Transpara's definition of a KPI?">
      There are a lot of academic definitions out there, but ours is crazy simple, we define a KPI as anything you care enough to track that has some form of expected behavior.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why is how Transpara defines a KPI so important?">
      In our approach, a KPI is what gives everything color or status and ability to alert. When a KPI crosses a threshold in Transpara, it can raise its hand to alert or engage a user and automatically build visualizations.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="How does this compare to how other applications like BI tools and reporting software to visualize information?">
      In a BI solution, you have to say 'I want a pie chart there.' There's no forced consistency around the concept of 'status.' 

      And while BI lets you make KPIs, you might make two right next to each other that could never be summarized. With BI, there's no way for the solution to look at everything and assess— it doesn't become a system, and you're left with only pieces and parts assembled. 

      With Transpara, the solution works without us (or our software) having to know what data is in there at all or where it comes from. Transpara's unique approach relies on a consistent pattern in how KPIs are defined, regardless of where the data comes from, how fast it moves, or how seemingly unrelated it's. KPIs are organized for end-user navigation with automatic roll-ups that show what's happening at any level of your hierarchy. These exception-based, at-a-glance views increase the speed of identifying problems or opportunities, while requiring less cognitive load from your users to find what they need. When compared to a BI tool or reporting software, Transpara allows you to much more easily visualize large volumes of data and KPIs at-a-glance and quickly find what needs your attention with intuitive filtering, sorting, grouping, and search – functioning more like the commercial apps you use every day such as Amazon, Zillow, and others.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Is Transpara self-service?">
      Yes. Transpara is so simple to use that most customers don't need any assistance at all once they are set up. First off, most apps in our space design their UIs based on other apps in the space— we go out of our way to base our UI on the consumer apps users are already familiar with. We work for power users and regular end users alike, too. If you're a power user, great, create your own KPIs. If you're a more traditional end user, think of Transapara as 'non-destructive.' We have visualizations already in place so you can choose and refine as needed without changing the system or the view.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Do I need a full-time person to manage/administer Visual KPI?">
      None of our customers has a full-time manager or admin in place. We may spend some initial time with you setting things up— after that, there are typically just small maintenance bits that may come up. You will have direct access to Transpara's support experts from initial deployment through to ongoing, proactive support. 
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can anyone create their own dashboards? Their own visualizations?">
      Yes, anyone can make dashboards. Admin can also lock them down, too, so that users can view but not edit dashboards, or secure them against specific users. If a user does want to edit one, they can make a copy and run edits.And, yes, you can take on visualizations, too, then filter, group, or sort those visualizations by different attributes. Again, Transapara is non-destructive, so you can do all of that without "breaking" the system or view.
