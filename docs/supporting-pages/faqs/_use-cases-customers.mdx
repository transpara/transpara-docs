    <Accordion title="Who are the users normally? Exec? Geeks? Senior vs junior?">
      Everyone from operators to management and field staff. We focus heavily on making software accessible to everyone, but never forget our ‘geek.' Some of our customers use Transpara in an IT sense but, then again, it often folds into other use cases for security, etc. Safety, quality, compliance/environmental, field staff/maintenance… Transpara works for everyone in any operational use case.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What industries is this most suited to? What industries do you focus on?">
      The Transpara platform isn't custom-built for a specific industry. In fact, it can be used in any industry or horizontal. Since our background and history center around process industries, the Transpara platform comes with a rigor, speed, and scale required by high-safety environments, but it can be used absolutely anywhere.
      
      Transpara's design allows for easy implementation in any industry. We work with a wide range of companies across a variety of industries, including but not limited to:
      - Energy & Utilities
      - Oil & Gas
      - Manufacturing
      - Mining
      - Pharma & Biotech
      - Telecommunications
      - IT Cloud & Data
      - Food & Beverage
      - Water & Wastewater
      - Facilities & Building Management
      - Core Infrastructure / Smart Cities
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="If I implement Transpara at one site, how easy is it to expand to additional">
      Very. Transapara is designed for rapid and repeatable implementation. Many of our customers have expanded into global rollouts with 25 or more sites
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Do you have a library of KPIs for my industry?">
      Yes, we have sample P' only at an industry level, but also at sub-industry, role-based and use case-based levels
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What are examples of your largest deployments?">
      How do you define “largest?” We define it in a number of ways at Transpara. Our “largest” deployments have been defined in terms of:
      - Number of KPIs
      - Data frequency
      - Number of sites
      - Data sources
      - Number of instances or tenants

      Some examples? With regards to KPIs, we had one client whose deployment involved around 550,000 KPIs centered on IT infrastructure and monitoring. In terms of data frequency, another customer's deployment involved 1000 sensors with about 2M inserts per second in total. One corporate client deployed to 26 sites, and another's deployment involved 45 radically different apps. Finally, we had a customer whose deployment involved 25 different tenants on a single server. So, yes, we can handle the big ones
