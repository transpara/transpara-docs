    <Accordion title="How often do you release new features and functionality (including fixes)? Do I need to upgrade the system each time? How easy is it to upgrade to a new version (downtime, resources required, etc)?">
      We do approximately 20 to 40 releases per year, but there's no need for you to upgrade at the same pace we release software. Our existing customers take a range of approaches, from upgrading every time to not upgrading for years, but it averages out at roughly every quarter to every 6 months. Upgrading takes just minutes and is backwards compatible.
