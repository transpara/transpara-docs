## Installation steps

Installing Visual KPI Designer, from start to finish, takes only three steps, and you can do it in about 5 minutes. 

<Callout type="warning" title="Close Microsoft Excel">
The installation should work just fine with Excel open, but we recommend closing it first to reduce possible errors.
</Callout>

To install the Visual KPI Designer, follow the steps below:

1. Access the [download page](https://www.transpara.com/software-downloads/) to get the latest Visual KPI Designer version. If you have a Transpara account, log in. Otherwise, create an account to access the download page.

<Callout type="info" title="Older Versions">
If you're running an older version of Visual KPI Server, you need to find the corresponding Visual KPI Designer version. Access the [Release Archive](https://www.transpara.com/download-archive/) to see a complete list of all available Visual KPI Designer versions.
</Callout>

2. Click the **Visual KPI Designer (.exe)** button to download the installer.

3. When the download is complete, run the **Visual-KPI-Designer-Setup.exe** installer. The file name may vary depending on the current software version.
4. Agree to the terms and conditions, and click **Install**.
5. When the installation is complete, click **Finish**.

Excel will open automatically after the installation process is completed. Visual KPI  Designer should now appear on the right side.

<Callout type="note" title="Updating the Visual KPI Designer">
If you're updating the Visual KPI Designer to a newer version, the steps are the same as the installation. As the new installation replaces the older version automatically, you don't need to uninstall it before updating. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="When Should You Update the Designer?">
The Visual KPI Designer should match your version of the Visual KPI Server. Therefore, you should update the Designer version when you update the Server software.
</Callout>
