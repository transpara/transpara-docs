### Light & Dark themes

By default, Visual KPI sites have a white background, which is the light theme. However, you can add a dark theme to reduce on-screen glare in environments where a black background would make more sense. In the Website configuration worksheet, find the attribute for **Default Color Theme**. Under the column **Value**, use the pull-down menu to select the light or dark theme as the default.

In addition, to choose the default theme, you can enable users to change between them. For the attribute **Allow Users to Change Color Theme**, select **TRUE** to allow, and **FALSE** if you don't want to enable this option. If you set **TRUE**, Visual KPI site users will see the option to toggle between light and dark themes under the Options icon.

### Timestamp display

Visual KPI shows your data in near real-time. The timestamp display in the top bar of Visual KPI sites shows you the exact time, down to the second, that the currently viewed data was returned. You can choose to display the timestamp based on the server or client time, even if the server and Visual KPI client are in different time zones.

Use **Allow Users to Change Client Display Time** and **Default Client Display Time** settings to define if users can change the display time and the default display time for your users. By default, the timestamp display in Visual KPI sites is set to **Client Time**, the time indicated by the device on which you access the Visual KPI client. If the timestamp is set to **Server Time** and your server is, for instance, set to New York time, the timestamp in Visual KPI will show New York time.

## KPI status

The KPI status configurations enable you to define each existing status's colors, icons, and custom names and abbreviations. In addition, if your company needs customized status, you can update the existing defaults or customize one of the **Custom Status** available. You can change anything and everything.

<Callout type="note" title="Reference">
Access the [KPI Status](/reference/visual-kpi-designer/site-settings/kpi-status) reference page to see the description for each available configuration.
</Callout>

When you access the KPI status worksheet, you will notice that a new panel with all statuses is available in addition to the available configurations in the worksheet. You can use this panel to configure each one of the existing KPI statuses:

- **Light/Dark themes** (<SvgFont icon="80"/>/<SvgFont icon="68"/>): Toggle between light and dark themes by clicking on the icon to preview the status icons.
- **Pick the light theme color** (<SvgFont icon="58"/>): Pick the color for the status when the system is using the light theme.
- **Pick the dark theme color** (<SvgFont icon="57"/>): Pick the color for the status when the system is using the dark theme.
- **Reset** (<PngFont name='resettodefault28' />): Return the status to the Visual KPI default configuration.
- **Change icon** (<PngFont name='selecticon28' />): Change the icon for the selected status.

  alt="KPI Status"
  size="60%"
/>

You can perform the above configuration through the worksheet as well. In addition, the worksheet allows you to enable a status as a filter, include it in roll-ups, and enable it as an alert. When you define statuses as alerts, you can configure the alert behavior. See [Alert Templates](/visual-kpi-designer/settings/contacts-alerts#configure-alert-templates) for additional information.

## Chart colors

Visual KPI automatically adds default colors to charts. Using Visual KPI Designer, you can configure these chart colors, replacing the defaults with any color.

<Image
src="media/designer/settings/features-config/chartscolors-worksheet.png"
alt="Chart Colors Worksheet"
/>

To customize a chart color, you should use the right panel:

1. Select the light or dark theme (<SvgFont icon="80"/>/<SvgFont icon="68"/>) to visualize the current color.
2. Click on the color selector for the corresponding theme:

 - Light theme (<SvgFont icon="58"/>).
 - Dark theme (<SvgFont icon="57"/>).

3. Select the desired color and click **OK**.

You can add a custom name for each color through the worksheet.

<Callout type="note" title="Reference">
Access the [Chart Color](/reference/visual-kpi-designer/site-settings/chart-color) reference page to see the description for each available configuration.
</Callout>

When custom chart colors are added, they become the new default colors sitewide, overriding the original Visual KPI defaults. These custom colors will appear in the pull-down menu for all charts with a color or pen option. The chart colors will update with your new custom colors for existing charts that use default colors.

<Callout type="warning" title="Color Visibility">
If you change any colors in the configurations, it is important to check the chosen colors for visibility on the light and dark themes.
</Callout>


## Features

Use the Features configuration worksheet to turn on or off specific Visual KPI features sitewide. When disabled, they disappear entirely from your Visual KPI site. Almost all features are enabled by default, but you can change them by setting **TRUE** to enable or **FALSE** to disable.

<Image

  alt="Features Worksheet"
/>

<Callout type="note" title="Reference">
Access the [Features](/reference/visual-kpi-designer/site-settings/features) reference page to see the description for each available configuration.
</Callout>

Enable **Site Roll-Ups** allows you to include roll-ups of KPIs from across all websites, not just the one associated with this worksheet. You may want to enable this if certain executives need to see roll-ups of all sites company-wide. You may not want to allow this for any site that's only for operators of this one site.
