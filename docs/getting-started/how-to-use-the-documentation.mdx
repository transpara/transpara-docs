On this page, we describe the different Visual KPI user types and options available for them. From this page, we define the paths of specific content each user should cover to optimize their time and learning curve, focusing on what you need to accomplish your goals.

## Visual KPI User Types

The Visual KPI documentation aims to provide content in a tailored way for three user types:

- **Administrator**: Administrators usually are from the IT team. They're responsible for the Visual KPI integration, covering the system preparation and installation. Administrators create or use existing interfaces to connect data sources to Visual KPI. In addition, if your company already has KPIs, the Administrator can use the automation tools provided by Transpara to import these KPIs into Visual KPI automatically.

- **Designer**: The Designer manages the Visual KPI configuration, preparing the system for end users to consume the data. They use the Visual KPI Designer tool, a versatile Excel-based solution, to set up the system's appearance and behavior. The Designer is responsible for creating visualization objects, such as KPIs, Charts, and Tables, and organizing them into Groups.

- **End-User**: The End-users of Visual KPI are the individuals who use the software to access data, reports, and insights. They consume the data available on Visual KPI after the integration from the Administrator and customization from the Designer. End-users don't necessarily require extensive technical knowledge to use Visual KPI. They're responsible for analyzing the available data.

## Documentation Structure

It is important to note that the documentation for Visual KPI has been organized to serve the three types of users - each with its own section and specific content to assist them in using the available tools. However, we suggest starting with the [Visual KPI Core Concepts](/core-concepts) to gain a general understanding of the platform's functionality.

After reading the core concepts, each user can continue to their specific section:

- [Setup and Administration](/setup-and-administration): This section was planned to help the Administrator install Visual KPI, create and start using interfaces, and show how to use the automation functionalities to import existing KPIs from your system into Visual KPI.
- [Visual KPI Design](/visual-kpi-designer/overview): Designers find in this section the necessary content to configure Visual KPI and create KPIs, Charts, Tables, and Groups.
- [End User](/end-user/overview): The guide for end users to learn how to use and take advantage of Visual KPI is available in this section.

In addition to these tailored sections, Visual KPI documentation provides support pages to cover specific needs, where you can find:

- [Reference guides](/references): These provide detailed documentation and information for users to refer to when they need in-depth knowledge or assistance regarding specific Visual KPI functionalities.
- [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)](/faqs): This section contains answers to common questions and issues that users may encounter while using Visual KPI, offering quick solutions.
- [Glossary](/glossary): Explore a list of key terms and their definitions to clarify technical jargon and terminology used within Visual KPI.

## What's Next?

If you are new to Visual KPI, we recommend accessing the [Visual KPI Core Concepts](/core-concepts) page first. If you are already familiar with Visual KPI, you can proceed to one of the pages described above, depending on your needs.
