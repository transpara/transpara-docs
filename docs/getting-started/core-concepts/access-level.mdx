Data security is a top priority for Transpara and Visual KPI. Various security measures are in place to safeguard your data at all process stages. From safely integrating data sources to presenting KPIs on the Visual KPI dashboard, you can choose who can access what type of data and function.

## Object-level security

Visual KPI implements object-level security for its sites, allowing you to tailor the security model and level of detail to your organization's needs. This involves creating user groups and assigning different access levels to each group. Since access permissions are defined at the object level, end-users won't notice any differences in the interface. Object-level security access groups are set up using the Visual KPI Designer.

The process for defining different access levels involves three simple steps:

1. Create local user groups.
2. Enable object-level security.
3. Assign different access levels to KPIs and Objects for the previously created groups.

As a result, KPIs and groups that aren't part of a user's access level won't appear on the screen. Consequently, user groups with different access levels can access the same dashboard but view different KPIs in their browser, ensuring the data is available only to those who should have access to it.

## What's next?

Now that you have covered all the core concepts of the Visual KPI, it's time to check the specific content for your role. If you aren't familiar with the documentation organization, access the [how-to-use-the-documentation](/how-to-use-the-documentation). Otherwise, you can see the specific section for each use type:
