## New Features

- **Requirements Update:**  
  Visual KPI now requires SQL Server 2016 or newer, updating from the previous requirement of SQL Server 2012. For more details, visit the [system requirements page](https://www.transpara.com/system-requirements).

- **Inline Multi-Select KPI-Based Charts:**  
  You can now multi-select KPIs in a list and choose a visualization. The list is retained for quick toggling between various visualizations or changing which KPIs to include or exclude.

- **Change Chart Type for Multi-Select KPI-Based Charts:**  
  A new feature allows you to change the chart type within a single dashboard widget for multi-select KPI-based charts.

- **Bookmark Folders:**  
  Introduced the ability to group bookmarks into folders on the bookmark bar. To configure, drag and indent an existing bookmark using the "edit bookmarksâ€¦" function. Indenting a bookmark makes it a child of the bookmark above it.

  Addressed a problem where KPI Blocks did not always change the time range on a latched dashboard.

  Corrected an issue where some chart widgets were not rendering correctly at 1/4 width on small screens.
